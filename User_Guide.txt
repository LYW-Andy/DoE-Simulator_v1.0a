MANUFACTURING YIELD DOE SIMULATOR
SIMPLE USER GUIDE
===================================

This guide explains in simple terms how to use each tab of the Manufacturing Yield DoE Simulator.

-------------------------------
GENERAL INTERFACE
-------------------------------

The app has a sidebar on the left with general settings:
- "Process Noise Level" slider controls how much random variation occurs in the process
- "Show Advanced Settings" checkbox reveals options to adjust how strongly each factor affects yield
- "About DoE Concepts" dropdown provides basic explanations of DoE terminology

The main area has four tabs that each serve a different purpose:

-------------------------------
TAB 1: SINGLE RUN
-------------------------------

WHAT IT DOES:
This tab lets you adjust one setting at a time to see how it affects yield.

HOW TO USE IT:
1. Move the sliders (Speed, Pressure, Temperature, etc.)
2. Watch the gauge chart update immediately
3. Look at the "Process Parameter Analysis" to see how each factor contributes

TEACHING VALUE:
Shows cause-and-effect relationship between individual settings and final yield.

-------------------------------
TAB 2: MULTIPLE EXPERIMENTS
-------------------------------

WHAT IT DOES:
This tab lets you run many experiments at once to generate data.

HOW TO USE IT:
1. Choose how many experiments to run (10-500)
2. Select the experiment type:
   - "Random": Generates random settings
   - "Grid": Creates a systematic grid of settings
   - "Custom DoE": Uses proper experimental design principles
3. Click "Run Experiments"
4. View the results table and charts
5. Download the data if needed

TEACHING VALUE:
Shows how collecting proper data helps us understand a process better than just making random adjustments.

-------------------------------
TAB 3: DOE ANALYSIS
-------------------------------

WHAT IT DOES:
This tab analyzes experiment data to show how each factor affects yield.

HOW TO USE IT:
1. Run experiments in Tab 2 first
2. Look at the "Main Effects Plots" to see which factors matter most
3. Use the "Interaction Plots" to see how factors work together
4. Check the "Pareto Chart" to see which effects are most important

TEACHING VALUE:
Shows which process settings actually matter and which ones interact with each other - helping identify what to focus on.

-------------------------------
TAB 4: RESPONSE SURFACE
-------------------------------

WHAT IT DOES:
This tab creates 3D models showing how to optimize yield.

HOW TO USE IT:
1. Run experiments in Tab 2 first
2. Select two factors to analyze (X-Axis and Y-Axis)
3. View the 3D surface and 2D contour plots
4. Click "Find Optimal Settings" to get recommendations

TEACHING VALUE:
Shows how to find the "sweet spot" of settings that gives the best yield - the ultimate goal of DoE in manufacturing.

-------------------------------
SUMMARY
-------------------------------

Think of the simulator as a journey:
1. Single Run = "What happens if I change this one thing?"
2. Multiple Experiments = "Let's collect proper data"
3. DoE Analysis = "What patterns can we see in our data?"
4. Response Surface = "Where's the optimal operating point?"

This sequence mirrors how DoE is actually used in real manufacturing to improve processes and quality.
